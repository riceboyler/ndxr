ndxr - FamilySearch Indexing Challenge
========================

ndxr is a Node.js project using DurandalJS in a mimosa skeleton. It will be a mobile-first (using Bootstrap3 RC1) site focused on making indexing records for FamilySearch.org into a game. The goal is to deploy the site to Windows Azure, but keep all development in JS, including calls to the DB (likely Mongo).

This project is just getting started...
